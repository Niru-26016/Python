# Python String and Number Utilities

This repository contains simple Python scripts for string manipulation and number analysis. Each script is self-contained and demonstrates a specific algorithm or utility.

## Contents

- **Alternate Case.py**  
  Reads a sentence from the user and returns a new string where alphabetic characters alternate in case, starting with lowercase. Non-letter characters remain unchanged.

- **compresed String.py**  
  Compresses a string by replacing sequences of the same character with that character followed by the count of repetitions (run-length encoding).

- **Magic Number.py**  
  Determines whether a given positive integer is a Magic Number (the repeated sum of its digits reduces to 1).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run any script using Python 3:
   ```sh
   python "Alternate Case.py"
   python "compresed String.py"
   python "Magic Number.py"
